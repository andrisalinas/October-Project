Are You Black, Or White, Or A Little Of Both<br>
Do You Hate, Or Love, Or A Little Of Both<br>
Is Your Worth, Your Might, Worth The Fight<br>
They Say Black Life Matters, But You Are White<br>
An Anger Sung From Decades Past<br>
Centuries Of Hate, Why Does It Last<br>
Ignorance Of Feelings Following Your Path<br>
A Difference Of Culture Lost In Fact<br>
Fact Of The Matter, All Are Mutts<br>
We All Started Out African Pure Of Blood<br>
A Mix Of Family Brought Many A Race<br>
Separated By Distance The Genes Wait<br>
The World Is Shrinking, Beauty Awakening<br>
Mixing The Colors None Forsaking<br>
Love Stronger, Greater Than Hate<br>
When We All Become One Again<br>
All Lives Matter, All Lives Gain<br>
