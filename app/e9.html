<center>Part of me</center>

<p><center>
They all wished they had a man like him,<br>
They all wished to be her,<br>
They all wished to have his looks.<br>
He kisses me in the only way I imagine a star feels when it burns,<br>
I can still look at him and see the same man,<br>
Who once cherished me,<br>
Praised me,<br>
Worshipped me,<br>
This is the reason I keep coming back,<br>
No body dances in the flame like we do,<br>
But this is the same man who promised me the stars,<br>
But gave me scars,<br>
the man who controlled my mind,<br>
And this body of mine was his to<br>
Do as he pleases,<br>
But, he would never do that, they say.<br>
We would have noticed, they say.<br>
She would of walked away, they say.<br>
We never saw the bruises, they say.
