<center>Trouble</center>

<p><center>
It follows me everywhere <br>
Never lets me sleep in peace <br>
The Memories make my weep <br>
Ye the memories make my eyes sore <br>
Trouble oh ye trouble <br>
Why do you follow me<br>
I cant think straight when your around <br>
My spirit leaves my body and looks deep into my soul <br>
Living life knowing not my goal <br>
Trouble oh ye trouble <br>
Why do u bother me<br>
I did some stuff but still dont deserve you <br>
My friends disappear and I lose count <br>
I fail due to the oppressors <br>
Trouble oh ye trouble <br>
When oh when will God take you away.
