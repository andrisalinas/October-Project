<center>SADitty of a Foolish Mind</center>

<p><center>
My dotage for her <br>
was given free rein, <br>
though she never cared a bit<br>
Nor did she ever feign; <br>
And soon it occurred to me <br>
that I was to blame <br>
For the hole in my heart <br>
and the bitter and agonising pain.<br>
I later realised: <br>
My dotage could soon become the cause of my bane,<br>
So I gathered myself <br>
and resolutely flushed her off my brain.<br>
Itd been a while and I was feeling kinda sane,<br>
Until I stumbled on this gripping deb dame <br>
And thenâ€¦ <br>
the story started all over again!
