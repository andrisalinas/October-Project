<center>I am not that girl</center>

<p><center>
I am not the girl you tried so hard to make.<br> You tried so hard to change me I felt like I was drowning.<br>
Your loud spoken word found thier way to my ears like the waves of the ocean.<br>
They tried to get me and bring me to a place I did not choose to be.<br> While I tried to fight back and keep breathing I lost my energy,<br> I lost my faith in life.<br> I let myself float with the waves you created so I would be perfect.<br> For you. But I regained my strengt. <br> I saw where I was heading and my heart wouldnt stop screaming because I AM NOT THAT GIRL.<br> You broke me but I am strong enough to live like this. <br>Because I am that girl.<br>That girl who loves and cares.<br>That girl who lives her life like she wants to.<br> I am that girl.<br>
