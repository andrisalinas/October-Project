<center>A PRAYING MOTHER</center>

<p><center>


A PRAYING MOTHER IS A KNIGHT IN SHINING ARMOUR,<br>
SHE NEVER SLEEPS NOR SLUMBERS,<br>
LIKE A SHEPHERD WATCHES OVER HIS FLOCK HER EYES WILL NEVER LEAVE YOUR SIGHT,<br>
HER KNEES ALWAYS ON THE GROUND AND YOUR NAME ALWAYS ON HER TONGUE.<br>
A PRAYING MOTHER IS FAR MORE PRECIOUS THAN THE JEWELS OF THE WORLD,<br>
HER LOVE PROTECTS YOU AND HER FAITH GUIDES YOU.<br>
A PRAYING MOTHER WE SHOULD ALL BE THANKFUL FOR,<br>
I AM THANKFUL FOR MINE..ARE YOU OF YOURS????<br>
