<center>The Truth About Love</center>

<p><center>

The truth about love<br>
Love will make you feel ways you never imagined you could<br>
Love will not always be there to wipe your tears away<br>
Loves eyes will make you melt in their gaze <br>
Making you surrender everything<br>
Love will make you feel like you finally have something to live for.<br>
Love will change you<br>
And 
Love will leave<br>
Leave you to pick up the pieces of who you use to be.<br>
Leave you to deal with the mess they have created.<br>
And<br>
No matter how many times you wish on a star <br>
Love will not come back
