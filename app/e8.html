Okay
<p>
Its soothing. <br>
The way the words slip out of your mouth.<br>
How every breath you take is a beat on my drum. <br>
How every day I hope for something I know will never come.<br>
But I know what this game is about. <br>
The winners win and the losers lose<br>
But the beggars suffer.<br>
Aching for whats most desirable <br>
Unable to find peace within themselves or the world <br>
Lost in the confusion <br>
Stuck between dream and reality.<br>
Its a joke. <br>
Nothing more than a silly lick, a shady rhyme.<br>
So Ill continue to beg. <br>
Ill go on knowing I will never have what I most desire<br>
But will know where my heart lies. <br>
Its cold, dark, yet reassuring. <br>
The answer isnt far from home but every time Im with you I feel so far from home <br>
I want to run, run back to whats familiar <br>
Run back to how it was before I lied. <br>
Before I told myself it would be okay and the days would get better.<br>
Because thats when it sets in<br>
Thats when the nights get longer <br>
The cold gets colder <br>
And the thoughts get louder <br>
But Im okay. <br>
Its okay. <br>
Nothing more than a simple hum. Like a cloudy day with a breeze. <br>
Just okay</p>
