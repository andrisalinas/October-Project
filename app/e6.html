<center>His Cell Phone</center>

<p><center>

He pretend as though she is not a big deal.<br> He will not touch her at an opportune time,<br> not even with her loudest plea.<br> He break her spirit when he does not handle her gently.<br> He ignore her when she is attempting to reach him,<br> but he is faithful to silence her before bed.<br>
In retrospect,<br> he reached out to her whenever he had big news,<br> she was the first to know.<br> He entrust his  precious secrets locked within her cypher.<br> She then encrypted them like the Egyptians hieroglyphic codes. <br>
To their detriment,<br> he failed to realize that she would no longer be able to function at his command unless he upgraded her.<br>
She is exceptionally beautiful.<br> Her soul is delicate,<br> her internal functions produces life,<br> her memory is eternal,<br> and it take more than a few keys to make her function properly.<br> She hopelessly need to be recharged for life.<br> She is his cell phone.<br>
