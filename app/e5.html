<center>For them to like me</center>

<p><center>
I had to be a fake<br>
for them to like me.<br>
My true light,<br>
apparently<br>
shone too brightly.<br>
They gave me the filters<br>
that I should wear<br>
so I could be part of the pictures<br>
that they would share.<br>
They taught me the cool words<br>
of their ABCs<br>
so that when I talk I never say<br>
what they are afraid to hear.<br>
They told me on and offline are not the same.<br>
That online one says I love you<br>
and offline one shows I dont care.<br>
I had to be a fake for people that didnt love me<br>
and things that didnt make sense.<br>
All those values were to be written<br>
but not practiced<br>
All those goals<br>
were to be reposted but never chased..<br>
All those comments were only words<br>
never intentions.. And deep conversations<br>
were a waste of time,<br>
Lets take a selfie always the most voted<br>
praised as more fun.<br>
And I had to be a fake to be part of a puzzle<br>
thats never whole<br>
for its pieces are never what they seem<br>
and no one<br>
can ever<br>
really fit in.<br>
So I am out<br>
away from all of it,<br>
I had to be a fake<br>
But I choose to be me instead.<br>
