<center>Be the change</center>

<p><center>

Be the change you want to be, <br>
Be the change in all you see, <br>
Rather than wanting to make things new, <br>
Improve them by the things you do, <br>
In lifes seas, ya going to drowned, <br>
I promise you can turn it round, <br>
At every turn, a battle new, <br>
Hit it head on and see it through, <br>
Hiding your head wont help you out, <br>
Nor standing still to just let out a shout, <br>
So for the life you want to see, <br>
Be the change you want to be. <br>
